# Stock Market Real-Time Data Analysis

## Overview
The **Stock Market Real-Time Data Analysis** project showcases the creation of a data pipeline that processes and analyzes live stock market data using **Apache Kafka** and various **AWS services**. This project highlights the power of real-time data processing in the financial sector.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Apache Kafka**
- **AWS EC2**
- **Amazon S3**
- **AWS Glue**
- **AWS Athena**

## Data Pipeline Architecture
The architecture of the data pipeline consists of the following components:
- **Python CSV App** (Producer): Simulates stock market data.
- **Kafka** (on EC2): Acts as the messaging system for real-time data streaming.
- **Consumer**: Retrieves and processes the data from Kafka.
- **Amazon S3**: Serves as the storage solution for the data.
- **AWS Crawler**: Catalogs the data in S3 for easy access and organization.
- **AWS Glue**: Manages the schema for the stored data.
- **Amazon Athena**: Enables querying of the data using standard SQL.

## How It Works
1. The project simulates stock market data from a CSV file.
2. Data is sent to Kafka running on an AWS EC2 instance for real-time streaming.
3. The consumer retrieves the data and stores it in an Amazon S3 bucket.
4. AWS Crawler scans the data and catalogs it for better organization.
5. AWS Glue manages the schema of the stored data.
6. Finally, data can be queried using Amazon Athena, providing insights and analysis capabilities.

## Key Learnings
- Acquired hands-on experience with **Kafka** and **AWS** integration.
- Developed an understanding of real-time data processing and storage solutions.
- Gained insights into the architecture and management of data pipelines.
